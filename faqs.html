    <h1 class="hed9">ABOUT PRIME FITNESS</h1>
    <br>
    <br>
    
    
    <p class="sg">Short for the Fast Lean Fit Method, the FLF Method originated from conditioning athletes–burning fat and toning muscle for peak performance.
      This sports-specific approach training gives a full-body, functional workout that activates all muscle groups simultaneously and engaging the
      core, resulting in a lean, toned body.
      
      WHAT KIND OF EQUIPMENT DO YOU USE TO TRAIN?
      We use free weights, Rogue strength and conditioning equipment, Bosu ball, medicine balls, battle ropes, resistance bands, and many
      different training equipment to help you reach your goals and overall strength.
      
      IS THIS LIKE CROSSFIT?
      No. Although we incorporate some components such as HIIT (high intense interval training), our training is unique to FLF. Our trainers
      are all certified and have proper workout sequences that do not lead to injury or have negative impact on the joints, tendons, and
      muscles.No. (Unless that is your goal, we can train you in a way to get you there.) Our resistance training is mostly focused on leaning out the
      body and toning and sculpting your muscles to make you sleek.
      
      IS THERE PARKING?
      Parking is located behind the Staples store inside Walgreens parking lot for 1 hour. Please park away from Staples entrance. And do
      not park at Walgreens or you will get towed.
      
      Is THERE A SHOWER?
      Yes. Shampoo, conditioner, and body wash included. Just bring your towel.
      
      WHAT TIME DO YOU OPEN/CLOSE?
      Our schedule is appointment based and we are open when we have our training sessions. Typically, we train
      7 days a week and train clients as early as 6:00am and as late as 9:00pm.
      
      DO YOU HAVE TREADMILLS?
      We have Woodway treadmills, the absolute best in the world. These super-quiet machines are the most comfortable surface you'llever run on. We use these to warm up, cool down, and sometimes our cardio bursts. You'll alternate between sprints, inclines, dynamic
      mode, and assume other positions on the treadmill you've never thought possible.
      
      CAN I CHOOSE MY TRAINER?
      You may request a preference, but we often choose the trainer that specializes in your fitness goals, addresses your needs, and works
      with your schedule.</p>
      <h1 class="hed9">FIRST TIME</h1>
      <br>
      <br>
      
      <p class="sg">
        Yes, you will be given a complimentary first personal fitness consultation and body assessment for the first session.

        WHEN SHOULD I ARRIVE FOR MY FIRST CLASS?
        Please arrive at least 10 minutes prior to the scheduled start time for your orientation. A waiver form will need to be signed before start
        time.
        
        WHAT THINGS SHOULD I KNOW FOR MY FIRST TIME?
        Wear comfortable workout clothes, ladies keep your jewelry to a minimum and hair out of the way, bring a hand towel if you want, wear
        good workout shoes, no cell phones.Before we get started, we want to assess where you stand on the fitness spectrum. This will involve a variety of exercises to see your
        cardio fitness, form, alignment, and strength. We will then discuss your fitness goals to set an achievable plan.
        
        HOW DO I SIGN UP FOR THE SESSION?
        Give us a call or shoot us an email to schedule for your first consultation. After that, we will work with you to set a schedule to get you
        started.
        
        CAN I COME EARLY TO WARM-UP?
        Yes. In fact, we encourage you to come 5-10 min. early to warm up. We have a stretching area and treadmills for use while you
        wait. That way, you're ready to go when it's your time.
        
        DO YOU HAVE A PLACE TO PUT MY STUFF?
        We have open cubbies against the wall to store your stuff.

        STUDIO POLICIES
      </h1>
      <br>
      <br>
      <p class="sg">If you miss your appointment for whatever reason, please give your trainer a 24-hour notice. A Late Cancel charge of $15 will occur if
        you cancel within 12 hours of a class start time. Otherwise it will be considered a "NO-SHOW" which means you pay full for that
        session. If you're late, please text/or notify your trainer. Your trainer may give you a workout plan you can finish on your own.
        
        CAN I MOVE MY RESERVATION?
        If you need to move your appointment but there is less than 12 hours until your scheduled class, that would be considered a
        cancellation and the above cancellation policy would apply. Sorry, no exceptions.
        
        WHAT ARE YOUR PAYMENT POLICIES?
        All class purchases are non-transferable, non-refundable, non-extendable. All monthly unlimited packages start on the date of first use. All monthly
        contracts are signed for auto renewal for each month or can be paid in full up front.
        
        WHAT PAYMENT METHOD DO YOU ACCEPT?
        To keep everything convenient, we accept credit cards for personal training sessions and group classes. We have a merchant account
        set up and keep your credit card on file and take out dues automatically through EFT (electronic funds transfer) through your financial
        institution. If you decide to cancel your training or put your training on hold, please give us a 15-day notice so you will not be charged
        for the following month.</p>

          We start on time and end on time. YOU are paying for your time. We want you to get you the best possible results. Plan ahead so you
will be on time.

2. RESPECT.
At Fast Lean Fit™, we want to create a positive workout atmosphere. Having a professional, respectful attitude to one another will be
enforced. No whining, we are not your mother.

3. BRING YOUR BEST.
Some days you will be tired, some days you will be pumped up to work out. We ask that you bring your personal best each time to get
the best out of training. We can coach, encourage, challenge, and push you...but it'll be up to you to bring the positive attitude and
effort.
